xml parser builtin based on expat.

COMPILATION:
./configure --with-bash=/path/to/bash/headers
make

I'm using libtool rather than bash own shobj-conf script to generate the dynamic library, not sure if it's a good idea or not.
The resulting library is really in src/.libs, i've added a symlink for convenience.

USAGE:

To load it use:

enable -f expat.so expat

To use it:

expat [-s start_callback] [-e end_callback] [-d data_callback]\
      [-c comment_callback] [file ...]

The callbacks are evaluated and are called as follows:

* start_callback:
The code will be evaluated at each start of a new
element. 2 variables will be set:
 - XML_NAME will contain the name of the element
 - XML_ATTRIBUTES is an associative array containing the
attributes

* end_callback:
will be evaluated at each end of a new element,
XML_NAME will contain the name of the element

* data_callback:
called between the element, it will set XML_DATA to free text.
However a single block of contiguous text free of markup may still
result in a sequence of calls to this handler. In other words, if
you're searching for a pattern in the text, it may be split across
calls to this handler

* comment_callback
will put the content of the comment in XML_COMMENT

eg:

expat -s 'declare -p XML_NAME XML_ATTRIBUTES' -e "declare -p XML_NAME" \
      -d "declare -p XML_DATA"  -c "declare -p XML_COMMENT" file.xml
