xml parser builtin based on expat.
(mainly to explore bash builtins, but can be useful)

To load it use:
enable -f expat.so expat

to use it;
xml [-s start_callback] [file ...]

start_callback will be evaluated at each start of a new element,
XML_NAME will contain the name of the element and XML_ATTRIBUTES is an
associative array containing the attributes


eg: expat -s 'delcare -p XML_NAME XML_ATTRIBUTES' foo.xml

work in progress.
