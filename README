Small autoconf template for a bash loadable builtin it provides a
"hello" builtin.

Only the files not generated by autoreconf are included
(./bootstrap.sh will create the configure script etc..)

You only need to replace the occurence of "hello" by the name of your
own builitin to get started

Open Questions:

1) As is it installs the .la together with the .so,
   but apparently it's needed on some platform. not sure what would
   be best.

2) The .so is built into ./src/.libs/ I don't find this very
convenient
