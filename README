xml parser builtin based on expat.
(mainly to explore bash builtins, but can be useful)

To load it use:
enable -f expat.so expat

to use it;
expat [-s start_callback] [-e end_callback] [-d data_callback] [-c comment_callback] [file ...]expat [-s start_callback] [file ...]

start_callback will be evaluated at each start of a new element,
XML_NAME will contain the name of the element and XML_ATTRIBUTES is an
associative array containing the attributes

end_callback will be evaluated at each end of a new element,
XML_NAME will contain the name of the element

data_callback: XML_DATA to free text However a single block of contiguous
text free of markup may still result in a sequence of calls to this handler. In other
words, if you're searching for a pattern in the text, it may be split across calls to
this handler

comment_callback will put the content of the comment in XML_COMMENT

eg: expat -s 'delcare -p XML_NAME XML_ATTRIBUTES' -e "declare -p XML_NAME" -d "declare -p XML_DATA"  -c "declare -p XML_COMMENT" foo.xml
work in progress.
